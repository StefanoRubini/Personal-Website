          Hello there, welcome to my personal website! You will find the most up-to-date information
          regarding my academic and career endeavors on this site, where the design of the website will
          be familiar to those who use Visual Studio Code often. This website was structured, styled and
          given functionality using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as I am learning web development and wanted
          to learn the fundamental tools used to create websites. I am a firm believer that learning the
          fundamentals first is important before moving onto higher level languages and frameworks. With
          the completion of this website, I feel much more confident with moving forward with utilizing
          modern technologies and frameworks for web development.

          <br>
          <br>
          I was born and raised in Las Vegas, Nevada, where I attended Chaparral High School from August
          2015 to May 2019, where I graduated with Advanced Honors. After graduating from high school, I
          immediately continued my education at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas Honors College, where
          I attended from August 2019 to December 2024 in pursuit of my Computer Science degree, where I
          graduated with University Honors and Magna Cum Laude. Currently, I am looking for work as a
          software engineer, where I would love to continue learning new technology, tools, and information,
          as I would love to continue developing my skills and problem solving abilities further.
          
          <br>
          <br>
          With regards to my personal life, I enjoy spending time with my girlfriend, friends, and family
          and going out to try new things and experiences. One of my favorite pastimes is going to a coffee
          shop or library and sitting down to learn a new programming language or improve my problem solving
          skills through LeetCode. Additionally, I love to visit new parks in Las Vegas and walking around
          while listening to music, as it helps to clear my mind and enjoy life. Furthermore, nothing beats
          driving around the city of Las Vegas with the windows rolled down on the rare occasions where it
          is cloudy and the weather is cool, and being able to enjoy life and its endless beauty.
